### The Project Idea
As a mix between past-time and coding practice, I wanted to work on a roguelike game / story generator, the likes of dwarf fortress or caves of qud - a game that randomly creates a world, plays out detailed interactions between NPCs and derives playable
content from the current world state. Now, for starters I wanted to create worlds that are earthlike, i.e. that have oceans, continents, and smaller islands, that look like they could have originated on our planet at some point, and it turned
out that there is quite a bit more to our continents than meets the eye. The project contains some research notes and sources, scripts that randomly create a world as a coordinate system of datapoints, and some visualizations.
